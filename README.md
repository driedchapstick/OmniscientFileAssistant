# Omniscient File Assistant
Omniscient File Assistant is a file management platform created for easy monitoring of file systems for remote end-user workstations. Through its monitoring and analysis features, OFA allows an organization to mitigate improper device usage and data storage before serious security incidents arise. 

Capabilities include regular metadata collection, centralized data storage and reporting, file matching via hashing and other criteria, file content scanning, server backups, and a robust searching tool. 

By utilizing Omniscient File Assistant, an organization can lessen their chances of having end-user data issues by preventing long-term storage of personal files, storage of restricted materials, and unauthorized modifications. Omniscient File Assistant will provide a one stop interface for administrators to log, flag, track and remove files at their discretion. Having a central interface for management will eliminate the need for multiple management apps and make administrators jobs simpler.
